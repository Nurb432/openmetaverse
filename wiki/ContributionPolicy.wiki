= Contribution Policy =

To make sure that we can accept your contributions and continue to distribute Open Metaverse Foundation software under the most free license possible, any contributions need to follow the following licensing conditions:

    * Your contribution is either wholly your own, or if it contains third party materials, they are licensed in a manner compatible with the Open Metaverse Foundation BSD license. If you rely on third party contributions, maintain the original licensing and copyright headers on source code or include a copy of the original license with binaries. We cannot accept any code under the GPL or similar licenses unless there is a specific F/OSS exemption for BSD-licensed projects.

    * You accept whole liability for any contributions you make for inclusion of third party intellectual property, in the jurisdiction of both yourself, and where the servers are located (United States). If you are unsure about the licensing conditions for a piece of source, do not include it and work around it. If you have a problem here, ask the rest of the developers as they may be able to help. 

    * You have not witnessed, seen or been party to the development of closed source software developed by Linden Lab. If you have been involved in in-house software development for Linden Lab, your contributions may affect the licensing of the main codebase and we cannot accept any contributions without a waiver from Linden Lab disclaiming any interest in your contributions.

    * You have not copied source code from the GPL Second Life viewer to submit your contribution. This includes other viewers (e.g. Hippo Viewer, Meerkat) derived from that codebase.

    * You have not studied source code from the GPL Second Life viewer or its derivatives within the last six (6) months. 

    * You submit your contributions to the repository under the Open Metaverse Foundation BSD license below.
