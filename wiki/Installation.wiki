#summary Installing, configuring, and running SimianGrid and SimianGridFrontend.

= Installation =

Until !SimianGrid has its first versioned released, you will need to check the code out of the SVN source repository. Use this command to check out the project source code into a folder named `simiangrid`:

{{{
svn checkout http://openmetaverse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ simiangrid
}}}

Inside the `simiangrid` folder you will find three more folders: `licenses`, `OpenSim`, and `Simian`.

  * `licenses` contains the license agreements for all of the source code and dependencies. !SimianGrid and related Open Metaverse Foundation projects are released under a three clause BSD license.
  * `OpenSim` contains an [http://www.opensimulator.org/ OpenSimulator] addon that connects !OpenSim regions to a !SimianGrid backend. You will need to copy the addon module into your !OpenSim addon-modules folder and rebuild. Complete build and installation instructions for this module can be found in the README.txt file in the `OpenSim/addon-modules/SimianGrid/` folder.
  * `Simian` contains two projects, `Grid` and `GridFrontend` for !SimianGrid and !SimianGridFrontend, respectively.

== !SimianGrid ==

SimianGrid is the core set of web services that provide a persistence layer for your world.

  # Make sure you have the all of the prerequisites installed. On Ubuntu, this command will install everything you need:
  `apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-mysql mysql-server php5-curl php5-xmlrpc`
  # Copy the contents of the `Grid` folder to a directory accessible by your webserver. !SimianGrid has only been tested with Apache and PHP 5.3.
  # Modify `config/config.php` to match your configuration. The config file contains comments describing what each setting does.
  # You will need a recent version of MySQL (at least 5.1). Import the `sql/database.mysql.sql` database definition for the Simian database to MySQL.
  # Import `sql/default_assets.sql` to install the default asset set.
  # Visit the URL that SimianGrid is installed at. If everything is working correctly it should print out `SimianGrid`. If you receive a blank page or an error, check for a log file in the `logs/` directory or your Apache error log.

== !SimianGridFrontend ==

!SimianGridFrontend is a user-facing web portal for your world that provides user creation and account management, grid administration, and web-based world login. Currently, !SimianGridFrontend is required to import the default asset set into !SimianGrid.

  # Copy the contents of the `GridFrontend` folder to a directory accessible by your webserver. !SimianGridFrontend has only been tested with Apache and PHP 5.3.
  # Go into the `application/config` folder and modify configuration options to fit your setup. You should only need to modify `config.php` and `database.php`. Make sure `$config['default_asset_folder']` points at the correct path for the `default_assets` folder that ships with !SimianGrid.
  # Import the `schema.sql` table definitions. You can import these into the Simian database created for !SimianGrid or another database.
  # Go to the starting page for !SimianGridFrontend and verify that it works. Next, try creating a user account and logging in and logging out.

== Running with !OpenSim ==

  # Once you have compiled !OpenSim with the !SimianGrid addon and modified the !SimianGrid.ini file to match your installation, you should be able to start one or more !OpenSim regions that will register themselves with the grid service.
  # You can now login with an !OpenSim-compatible viewer using the login.php script. If you installed !SimianGrid at `http://www.mygrid.com/`, launch your viewer with:
