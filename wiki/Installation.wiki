#summary Installing, configuring, and running SimianGrid and SimianGridFrontend.

= Installation =

Until !SimianGrid has its first versioned released, you will need to check the code out of the SVN source repository. Use this command to check out the project source code into a folder named `simiangrid`:

{{{
svn checkout http://openmetaverse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ simiangrid
}}}

  * `Simian` contains three projects, `Grid` (!SimianGrid), `GridFrontend` (!SimianGridFrontend), and `GridWebDAV` (SimianGridWebDAV)

== !SimianGrid ==

SimianGrid is the core set of web services that provide a persistence layer for your world.

  # Make sure you have the all of the prerequisites installed.  Some examples which will install everything you need:

  _Ubuntu_:
    `apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-mysql php5-curl php5-gd php5-xmlrpc mysql-server`

  _OpenSUSE_:
    `zypper install apache2 php5 php5-mysql php5-curl php5-gd php5-xmlrpc mysql`

  # Copy the contents of the `Grid` folder to a directory accessible by your webserver. !SimianGrid has only been tested with Apache and PHP 5.3.
  # Modify `config/config.php` to match your configuration. The config file contains comments describing what each setting does.
  # You will need a recent version of MySQL (at least 5.1). Import the `sql/database.mysql.sql` database definition for the Simian database to MySQL.
  # Import `sql/default_assets.sql` to install the default asset set.
  # Visit the URL that SimianGrid is installed at. If everything is working correctly it should print out `SimianGrid`. If you receive a blank page or an error, check for a log file in the `logs/` directory or your Apache error log.

== !SimianGridFrontend ==

!SimianGridFrontend is a user-facing web portal for your world that provides user creation and account management, grid administration, and web-based world login. Currently, !SimianGridFrontend is required to import the default asset set into !SimianGrid.

  # Copy the contents of the `GridFrontend` folder to a directory accessible by your webserver. !SimianGridFrontend has only been tested with Apache and PHP 5.3.
  # Go into the `application/config` folder and modify configuration options to fit your setup. You should only need to modify `config.php` and `database.php`. Make sure `$config['default_asset_folder']` points at the correct path for the `default_assets` folder that ships with !SimianGrid.
  # Import the `schema.sql` table definitions. You can import these into the Simian database created for !SimianGrid or another database.
  # If you want to allow users to sign in with OpenID credentials, make sure the directory to which `$config['openid_storepath']` is set in `GridFrontend/application/config/openid.php` is writable by the web server.
  # Go to the starting page for !SimianGridFrontend and verify that it works. Next, try creating a user account and logging in and logging out.


== Running with !OpenSim ==

  # Once you have configured your !OpenSim.ini file to use the !SimianGrid.ini include, and modified your !GridCommon.ini file with the !SimianGrid service URLs (look at !SimianGrid.ini for example URLs), you should be able to start one or more !OpenSim regions that will register themselves with the grid service.
  # You can now login with an !OpenSim-compatible viewer. If you installed !SimianGrid at `http://www.mygrid.com/`, launch your viewer with:

{{{
-loginuri http://www.mygrid.com/login/
}}}

 (note the trailing slash). You may need to append index.php to the end of the loginuri if your web server is not configured to serve up php files by default.
