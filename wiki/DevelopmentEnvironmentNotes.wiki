= *Introduction* =

For now I'll cover briefly what I installed, in no particular order excepting the base ubuntu, which necesarily came first.

Later, as I have more detail, I'll make some notes concerning windows environments.


= *Linux Environment Details* =

This may or may not be the preferred/ideal development environment, but it's the one that I have found best satisfies the dependencies.

After a base installation of Ubuntu Lucid, I installed the repositories package, updated package lists, and upgraded everything.

I then installed:<br>
apache 2.2.14<br>
php5.3.2<br>
MariaDB 5.1<br>
subversion<br>
openssh<br>
git<br>

I also installed php-cli, but its probably not necesary to the success of the environment. I should probably updgrade everything again, or else install all the forgoing before upgrading.

Also, per the [Installation] instructions, I installed the PHP extensions 'php5-mysql php5-curl php5-gd' and 'php5-xmlrpc'.


_Like most such pages, this one is a work in progress - I'll update/edit it as I have information in greater detail._
